The Shopping Trend Analysis project focuses on analyzing and understanding consumer behavior and shopping trends based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, data visualization, and statistical analysis, this project aims to uncover patterns, predict future shopping behaviors, and offer insights that businesses can use to optimize their marketing strategies, improve sales, and enhance customer experience.

Project Features:
 * Data Collection: Gathering diverse datasets from multiple sources like e-commerce platforms, social media, and retail 
 websites.
 * Data Cleaning: Preprocessing raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing key trends and insights from the collected data.
 * Feature Engineering: Creating new features that could improve the model's predictive accuracy.
 * Machine Learning Models: Developing models such as Time Series Analysis, Classification, and Clustering to forecast 
   shopping trends.

Visualization: Creating interactive and informative dashboards to present the shopping trends and predictions.
